# Pass The Pigs - Dice variation!

The objective of this game is to be the first player to reach **100 points**. Instead of using flipping pigs to score points, the game has been made to use a dice. However, rolling a one will reset the current score to **0** and automatically switch to the other player's turn. So, be careful not to get too greedy!

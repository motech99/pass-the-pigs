# Pass The Pigs - Dice Variation!

The objective of this game is to be the first player to reach **100 points**. Instead of using flipping pigs to score points, the game has been modified to use a dice. However, rolling a one will reset the current score to **0** and automatically switch to the other player's turn. So, be careful not to get too greedy!

## Rules:
1. The game is played by two players taking turns.

2. Each player starts with a score of 0.

3. On your turn, roll the dice by clicking the "Roll" button.

4. The number rolled on the dice will be added to your current score.

5. You can continue rolling the dice to accumulate points until:
   - You choose to "Hold" your current score. Your current score will be added to your total score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
   - You roll a one, which resets your current score to 0, and it becomes the next player's turn. Players must wait until the dice is reset before taking their turn.

6. If you reach 100 points or more, you win the game!

7. The game continues until a player reaches the winning score.

Remember, don't get too greedy and risk losing your accumulated points by rolling a one. Wait until the dice is reset before taking your turn. Good luck and enjoy playing Pass the Pigs!
